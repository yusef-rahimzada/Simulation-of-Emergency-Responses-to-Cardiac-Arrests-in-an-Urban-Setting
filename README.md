Simulation of Emergency Responses to Cardiac Arrests in an Urban Setting

Overveiw: Led exploratory data analysis, with a focus on removing outliers and comprehending case distribution across geographical and temporal dimensions. Applied maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments estimation to derive distribution parameters, utilizing Q-Q plots to pinpoint the best-fit distribution. Identified variations in cases by day of the week and time across all sectors, strategically leveraging these insights to optimize ambulance placement, refine shift assignments, and adhere to budget constraints, resulting in a 21% increase in theoretical survival rates.
